            <h1 class="text-3xl">Terms and Conditions:</h1>
            <li>1. These terms and conditions govern the use of our online ticketing platform and services. By using the
                website, you agree to abide by these terms. You must be at least 18 years old to use this platform, and
                if under 18, you must have consent from a parent or guardian. Nabil Paribahan reserves the right to
                update these terms without prior notice.</li>
            <li>2. All bookings are subject to seat availability. Tickets are confirmed only after full payment is
                successfully processed. Providing accurate personal information is mandatory; failure to do so may
                result in cancellation.</li>
            <li>3. Ticket cancellations are allowed up to 24 hours before departure, and a cancellation fee may apply.
                Refunds are processed via the original payment method and may take time based on the payment provider.
                Tickets are non-refundable and non-transferable after the scheduled departure.</li>
            <li>4. Passengers must bring a printed or digital copy of their ticket and a valid photo ID for verification.
                Boarding is permitted only at the location and time specified on the ticket. Late arrivals or no-shows
                will result in ticket forfeiture without a refund.</li>
            <li>5. Passengers may select seats during booking, subject to availability. Nabil Paribahan reserves the right
                to reassign seats for operational reasons.</li>
            <li>6. Each passenger is allowed one piece of luggage and one carry-on item. Extra luggage may incur additional
                fees, and passengers must adhere to baggage size and weight limits. Nabil Paribahan is not responsible
                for lost or damaged belongings, and passengers are advised to keep valuables with them.</li>
            <li>7. Passengers are required to follow all safety guidelines and instructions from staff. Disruptive or
                unlawful behavior may result in denial of boarding or removal from the bus without a refund.</li>
            <li>8. Nabil Paribahan will endeavor to maintain schedules but is not liable for delays caused by traffic,
                weather, or unforeseen circumstances. In case of service cancellation, passengers can opt for a full
                refund or reschedule their journey.</li>
            <li>9. Coupons must be applied during booking and cannot be redeemed afterward. Once a coupon is applied, the
                input field will reset automatically.</li>
            <li>10. Passengers cannot select more than four seats per booking. Attempting to do so will result in an
                on-screen alert, and the selection will be restricted.</li>
